q1: makes sense
q2: check notes
q3: check formula sheet, %BranchInstructions * %OfBranchOutcome * BranchPenalty
q4: Fetch (I-Fetch) unit, we look at the latency of the components involved in the instruction fetch stage. 
Typically, the I-Fetch stage involves accessing the instruction memory (I-Mem) to read an 
instruction and preparing the next instruction address, which usually involves an adder for incrementing the 
program counter (PC).

consecutive instructions, the cycle time would be limited by the longest latency operation in the I-Fetch unit.

q5: LWI: load word from memory to register, uses register Rd in Rs to form memory address, from
which to load. 
Reg[Rt] indicates that this instruction writes to a register, which means the Register Write Port is needed.

Mem[...] indicates that the instruction reads from memory, so the Data Memory block is used.

Reg[Rd] + Reg[Rs] suggests that an addition operation is needed to calculate the memory address, implying the use of the ALU.

Additionally, since the instruction would need to read from two registers to get the values of Rd and Rs, the Register Read Ports are also used.

And finally, like all instructions, it must be fetched from the Instruction Memory.
