PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/coffee_mealy_0/inst/coffee_mealy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/coffee_mealy_inst/next_state_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/coffee_mealy_0/inst/coffee_mealy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/coffee_mealy_inst/next_state/O, cell design_1_i/coffee_mealy_0/inst/coffee_mealy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/coffee_mealy_inst/next_state. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/coffee_mealy_0/inst/coffee_mealy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/coffee_mealy_inst/out_inferred__0/i__n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/coffee_mealy_0/inst/coffee_mealy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/coffee_mealy_inst/out_inferred__0/i_/O, cell design_1_i/coffee_mealy_0/inst/coffee_mealy_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/coffee_mealy_inst/out_inferred__0/i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
